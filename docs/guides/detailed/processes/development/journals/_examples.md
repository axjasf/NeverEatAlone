# Development Journal Examples

This document provides concrete examples of development journals for different scenarios, with explanations of key practices and patterns.

## Initial Feature Branch Example

The following example demonstrates best practices for starting a new feature branch, particularly one that is part of a larger change request:

```markdown
# Development Journal - [feature/47-contact-service-implementation]
Version: 2025.02.24-1-contact-service

## Status Summary
- Phase: Initial Design
- Progress: Starting
- Quality: Yellow (design needs validation)
- Risks:
  - Design patterns need validation against real use cases
  - Integration with existing domain models needs verification
  - Documentation consistency across service layer
- Dependencies:
  - âœ… [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_BASE.md]
  - âœ… CR-44 Base Service implementation

## Current Focus
### Documentation Structure
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Initial design
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Service layer patterns
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/OVERVIEW.md] Feature documentation
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/crs/CR-2024.02-44.md] CR update

... (rest of the example)
```

### Key Practices Demonstrated

1. **Document References**
   - Use `[filepath]` format for all document references
   - Include full path on first reference
   - Add descriptive suffix explaining purpose
   Example:
   ```markdown
   [ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Initial design
   ... later ...
   [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Review core features
   ```

2. **Status Tracking**
   - Start with Yellow quality for new features
   - List specific risks and dependencies
   - Track documentation separately from implementation
   Example:
   ```markdown
   - Quality: Yellow (design needs validation)
   - Risks:
     - Design patterns need validation against real use cases
   ```

3. **Documentation Flow**
   - Group related document changes
   - Track documentation through feature lifecycle
   - Link to workflow guide requirements
   Example:
   ```markdown
   5. [ ] Documentation updates (per workflow guide)
      - On pattern discovery:
        - [ ] [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Layer interactions
   ```

4. **Technical Progress**
   - Separate implementation from documentation status
   - Use symbols consistently ([ ], âœ…, ðŸ’¡, ðŸ”„)
   - Track decisions and insights
   Example:
   ```markdown
   ### Technical Decisions
   [ ] Validate BaseService patterns fit
   ðŸ’¡ Keep implementation focused on essential features
   ðŸ”„ Complex operations deferred to future
   ```

### When to Use This Pattern

This example is particularly suitable for:
1. Feature branches that are part of larger changes
2. Components with significant documentation requirements
3. Features that affect multiple architectural layers
4. Implementation work that needs careful validation

### Customization Points

Sections that should be customized based on context:
1. Documentation Structure: List relevant documents for your feature
2. Implementation Planning: Adjust based on feature scope
3. Technical Decisions: Focus on decisions relevant to your component
