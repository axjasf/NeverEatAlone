# Development Journal - [branch-name]
Version: YYYY.MM.DD-N-branch-id

<!--
KEY GUIDELINES:
1. Fixed Sections (in order):
   Feature Journal Structure:
   - Status Summary: Phase, progress, quality, risks, dependencies
   - Current Focus: Active work, challenges, dependencies
   - Next Steps: Immediate tasks, upcoming work
   - Technical Progress: Implementation status, test status
   - Technical Decisions: Key architectural and technical choices
   - History: Newest entries first, with concrete technical details

   Sprint Journal Structure:
   - Status Summary: Overall sprint health
   - Current Focus: Status per feature, with active challenges
   - Next Steps: Sprint-level priorities
   - Technical Progress: Cross-feature implementation, patterns
   - Technical Decisions: Architecture evolution, shared patterns
   - Sprint Learnings: Cross-feature insights
   - History: Oldest first, tracking feature flow

2. Symbols:
   ✅ = Completed item
   [ ] = Planned/in-progress item
   💡 = Technical learning/insight
   🔄 = Future consideration (uncovered but not yet explored)
   ⏸️ = Parked item (planned but later deemed optional)
   🔵 = Branch creation (sprint journals)
   🔹 = Branch merge (sprint journals)

3. Symbol Usage Examples:
   🔄 Future consideration:
   - "Need to consider error retry behavior" (discovered during implementation)
   - "Caching might be needed here" (noticed potential bottleneck)
   - "Consider adding validation" (uncovered edge case)

   ⏸️ Parked item:
   - "Structured logging" (planned but simple logging sufficient)
   - "Correlation IDs" (planned but not needed for single user)
   - "Complex error tracking" (planned but basic errors work fine)

4. Keep entries:
   - Focused on what matters
   - Technical and concrete
   - Free of routine progress

5. History Examples:
   Feature Journal:
   ### 2024.02.23-2-feature-30
   - ✅ Implemented timezone validation
   - 💡 Repository pattern works well here
   - 🔄 Might need caching (noticed in testing)
   - ⏸️ Complex validation rules (planned but basic rules sufficient)

   Sprint Journal:
   ### 2024.02.13-2-sprint-02
   - 🔵 CR-23 (Timezone Implementation) branched
   - ✅ Base timezone validation defined
   - 💡 UTC standardization reduced complexity
   ### 2024.02.22-6-sprint-02
   - 🔹 CR-23 merged back into sprint
   - ✅ All timezone components verified
   - 💡 Cross-feature pattern emerged for validation
