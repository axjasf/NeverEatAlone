# Feature: Service Layer Implementation

## Status
- Created on: Feb-23, 2025
- Last updated: Feb-23, 2025
- Last activity: ðŸ”„ In Design Documentation Phase

## Overview
The Service Layer Implementation represents a critical architectural milestone in our application's evolution. As outlined in [CR-44](crs/CR-2024.02-44.md), this layer addresses the need for coordinating complex business operations that span multiple domain models and repositories.

### Purpose and Scope
Currently, our domain models contain business rules but lack a way to coordinate operations like "create a contact with tags" or "update a note and its statements". The service layer will:
1. Handle these multi-step operations consistently
2. Ensure data isn't partially updated if something fails
3. Provide clear error messages for debugging

See [CR-44 Executive Summary](crs/CR-2024.02-44.md#2-executive-summary) for detailed rationale.

### Design Philosophy
Following the single-user context of our application, we're adopting a pragmatic approach that provides:
- Just enough structure to keep the code clean and data consistent
- Clear transaction boundaries for data integrity
- Simplified error handling for effective debugging
- Basic logging for operation tracking

For detailed architectural decisions, see [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md](design/SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Components
1. Service Layer Foundation (CR-44 In Progress)
   - Base Service Patterns
     - Transaction management
     - Error handling strategy
     - Service coordination
     - Domain event handling
   - Test Infrastructure
   - Cross-Cutting Concerns

2. Business Services (Planned)
   - Contact Management
     - Contact lifecycle
     - Template validation
     - Tag management rules
     - Search criteria
   - Note Management
     - Note/Statement workflow
     - Interaction tracking rules
     - Tag application rules
   - Reminder Management
     - Scheduling and recurrence
     - Timezone-aware notifications
     - Status transitions
   - Template Management
     - Version control
     - Field definitions
     - Migration rules
   - Tag Management
     - Tag lifecycle
     - Frequency tracking
     - Cross-entity relationships

3. Integration Points
   - Repository to Service (internal)
     - Data access patterns
     - Transaction scopes
     - Query optimization
   - Service to API (upcoming)
     - DTO mapping
     - Validation rules
     - Error translation

## Architecture Layers
As defined in [CR-44 Impact Analysis](crs/CR-2024.02-44.md#33-impact-analysis):

1. **Service Layer** (Highest)
   - Coordinates business operations
   - Manages transactions and consistency
   - Uses domain models and repositories
   - Handles business errors

2. **Domain Layer**
   - Business objects (Contact, Note, etc.)
   - Business rules and validation
   - Pure Python objects
   - No ORM dependencies

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - ORM Models: SQLAlchemy mappings of domain objects
   - Repositories: Data access patterns
   - Database operations
   - Transaction handling

## Change Requests
- ðŸ”„ CR-44: Service Layer Foundation
  - Design documentation in progress
  - Base patterns and infrastructure
  - Example implementation with Contact Service

## Implementation Approach
Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) as outlined in [CR-44 Implementation Plan](crs/CR-2024.02-44.md#52-tdd-implementation-steps):
1. Base Service implementation with transaction management
2. Error handling patterns
3. Example Contact Service implementation
4. Integration test patterns
