# CR-2024.02-48: Contact Management Core CRUD Requirements Refinement

## 1. Change Request Information
- **CR Number**: CR-2024.02-48
- **Title**: Contact Management Core CRUD Requirements Refinement
- **Type**: Requirements Refinement
- **Status**: Ready for Review
- **Author**: System
- **Date Created**: 2024-02-25
- **Date Last Updated**: 2024-02-25
- **Version**: 1.1
- **Parent CR**: CR-2024.02-47 (Contact Service Implementation)

## 2. Executive Summary
During the implementation of CR-47 (Contact Service), we identified missing explicit requirements for core CRUD operations in the Contact Management BRD. While these operations are implicitly required to support existing functionality, they should be explicitly documented to ensure complete requirements coverage and clear implementation guidance.

## Action Items
1. Update Functional Requirements:
   - ✅ Add section 1.3 Core Operations to `functional.md`
   - ✅ Add the three new requirements (FR1.3.1-3)
   - ✅ Ensure proper cross-references to existing requirements
   - ✅ Review section placement and numbering

2. Update Service Design:
   - ✅ Update `SERVICE_CONTACT.md` to reference new requirement IDs
   - ✅ Ensure test coverage plan includes new requirements
   - ✅ Validate interface documentation matches requirements

3. Validation:
   - ✅ Review all cross-references for accuracy
   - ✅ Verify no gaps in CRUD operations
   - ✅ Check impact on existing documentation
   - ✅ Ensure backward compatibility

## 3. Requirements Analysis

### 3.1 Current State
The following core operations are now explicitly documented:
1. Delete contact (FR1.3.2)
2. Get contact by ID (FR1.3.1)
3. Search contacts by criteria (FR1.3.3)

### 3.2 Cross-Reference Analysis
Each core operation has bidirectional relationships with existing requirements:

#### FR1.3.1: Retrieve by ID
- Required by:
  - FR4.1.1: Show contacts grouped by tags (needs to get contact details)
  - FR4.1.2: Display contact staleness (needs current contact state)
  - FR3.1.4: Update contact tracking (needs current contact)
  - FR1.1.3: Support contact briefing (needs contact to update)

#### FR1.3.2: Delete Contact
- Affects:
  - FR2.1.3: Prevent duplicate tags (cleanup needed on delete)
  - FR3.1.4: Update contact tracking (must handle deleted contacts)
  - FR4.1.1: Show contacts grouped by tags (must handle deleted state)
- Required by:
  - Basic data management (implicit requirement)
  - Data cleanup operations

#### FR1.3.3: Search Contacts
- Required by:
  - FR4.1.1: Show contacts grouped by tags (needs filtered contacts)
  - FR4.1.2: Display contact staleness (needs filtered contacts)
  - FR4.1.3: Highlight overdue contacts (needs filtered contacts)
- Depends on:
  - FR1.1.*: Basic contact information (for search fields)
  - FR2.1.*: Tag information (for tag-based search)
  - FR3.2.*: Interaction data (for date-based search)

### 3.3 Proposed Changes
✅ Added new section to functional requirements:

#### 1.3 Core Operations
- FR1.3.1: System MUST support retrieving contacts by unique identifier
- FR1.3.2: System MUST support deleting contacts with all associated data
- FR1.3.3: System MUST support searching contacts by multiple criteria

### 3.3 Impact Analysis

#### Documentation Impact
1. **BRD Updates**
   - ✅ Added section 1.3 Core Operations to functional requirements
   - ✅ Updated references to these operations in other sections

2. **Service Design Updates**
   - ✅ Updated requirement references in SERVICE_CONTACT.md
   - ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage plan
   - ✅ Added error handling examples
   - ✅ Added transaction boundary examples

## 4. Documentation Updates

### 4.1 Required Updates
1. **Functional Requirements** (`docs/brd/modules/contact_management/requirements/functional.md`)
   - ✅ Added section 1.3 Core Operations
   - ✅ Updated cross-references

2. **Service Design** (`docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_CONTACT.md`)
   - ✅ Updated requirement references for core operations
   - ✅ Added detailed test coverage plan
   - ✅ Added error handling examples
   - ✅ Added transaction examples

### 4.2 Version Updates
- Previous Version: 1.0.0
- Current Version: 1.1.0
- Version Update Justification: Added error handling examples and completed final validation

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Documentation Steps
1. ✅ Update functional requirements document
2. ✅ Review updates with team
3. ✅ Update service design document
4. ✅ Verify requirement coverage in tests

### 5.2 Verification Steps

2. ✅ Confirm requirement IDs are properly referenced
3. ✅ Check test coverage alignment
4. ✅ Review documentation consistency

## 6. Review Points

### 6.1 Requirements Review
- ✅ Completeness of core operations
- ✅ Clarity of requirements
- ✅ Proper requirement numbering
- ✅ Cross-reference accuracy

### 6.2 Impact Review
- ✅ Documentation updates identified and completed
- ✅ Test coverage implications documented
- ✅ Implementation impact assessed

### 6.3 Technical Decisions
1. **Requirement Structure**
   - ✅ Core operations placed in section 1.3
   - ✅ Maintains consistent numbering scheme
   - ✅ Preserves existing requirement relationships

2. **Requirement Dependencies**
   - ✅ Explicit links to supported features
