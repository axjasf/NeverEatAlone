# Development Journal - [branch-name]
Version: YYYY.MM.DD-N-branch-id

<!--
KEY GUIDELINES:
1. Fixed Sections (in order):
   Feature Journal Structure:
   - Status Summary: Phase, progress, quality, risks, dependencies
   - Current Focus: Active work, challenges, dependencies
   - Next Steps: Immediate tasks, upcoming work
   - Technical Progress: Implementation status, test status
   - Technical Decisions: Key architectural and technical choices
   - History: Newest entries first, with concrete technical details

   Sprint Journal Structure:
   - Status Summary: Overall sprint health
   - Current Focus: Status per feature, with active challenges
   - Next Steps: Sprint-level priorities
   - Technical Progress: Cross-feature implementation, patterns
   - Technical Decisions: Architecture evolution, shared patterns
   - Sprint Learnings: Cross-feature insights
   - History: Oldest first, tracking feature flow

2. Symbols:
   âœ… = Completed item
   [ ] = Planned/in-progress item
   ğŸ’¡ = Technical learning/insight
   ğŸ”„ = Future consideration/evolution point
   ğŸ”µ = Branch creation (sprint journals)
   ğŸ”¹ = Branch merge (sprint journals)

3. Keep entries:
   - Focused on what matters
   - Technical and concrete
   - Free of routine progress
