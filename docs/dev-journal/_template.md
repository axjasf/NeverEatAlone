# Development Journal - [branch-name]
Version: YYYY.MM.DD-N-branch-id

<!--
GUIDELINES:
1. Document Structure:
   - Headline structure is fixed - do not add new headline levels
   - Only use # for document title
   - Only use ## for main sections
   - No additional levels of headlines
   - Sections are: Current Focus, Progress & Decisions, Next Steps, Status, History

2. Symbols & Their Usage:
   âœ… = Completed items (always at start of line)
   [ ] = Only for concrete planned/in-progress items
   ðŸ”„ = Future integration points/architectural evolution ideas
   ðŸ’¡ = Specific technical insights/learnings (not general observations)

3. Structure Rules:
   - Keep sections focused and concise
   - Use consistent symbol placement
   - Don't mix symbols in section headers
   - Group related items logically
   - Leave items without symbols if they're just descriptive

4. History Entries:
   - Newest entries first
   - Each entry should capture:
     * One key completed milestone (âœ…)
     * Specific technical learnings (ðŸ’¡)
     * Notable evolution points (ðŸ”„) if discovered
   - Focus on what actually mattered, not routine progress
   - Keep it high-level but technically meaningful
