# Development Journal - [23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
Version: 2025.02.20-7-feat-23.5

## Current Focus [23.5]
### Tag BO Timezone Implementation
- 🔴 BLOCKED: Tag relationship event handling issues
- ✅ SQLite timezone handling patterns established
- ✅ Frequency field implementation complete
- ✅ Basic timestamp tracking working
- 💡 Need to branch out to 23.6 for association table consolidation

### Active Tasks
1. Domain Model
   - ✅ Base structure defined
   - ✅ Timezone validation implemented
   - ✅ Frequency field handling complete
   - ✅ Audit field tracking verified
   - 🔄 Relationship handling pending 23.6

2. Test Implementation
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - ✅ SQLite timezone patterns established
   - ✅ Basic timestamp tests passing
   - 🔄 Association table tests moved to 23.6
   - 🔄 Relationship event tests moved to 23.6

3. ORM & Repository Layer
   - ✅ Basic ORM model defined
   - 🔄 Association tables moved to 23.6
   - 🔄 Event listeners moved to 23.6
   - [ ] Repository integration pending

## Progress & Decisions [23.5]
### Implementation Status
1. Domain Model (100%)
   - ✅ Base structure complete
   - ✅ Timezone validation working
   - ✅ Frequency handling implemented
   - ✅ Audit fields verified
   - ✅ UTC conversion confirmed

2. Test Framework (80%)
   - ✅ Base patterns established
   - ✅ SQLite timezone handling solved
   - ✅ Basic tests passing
   - [ ] Association tests needed
   - [ ] Event tests pending

3. ORM & Repository (40%)
   - ✅ Basic model structure complete
   - ❌ Association tables blocked
   - ❌ Event listeners blocked
   - [ ] Integration pending

### Technical Decisions [23.5]
1. SQLite Timezone Handling
   - ✅ Pattern: Strip timezone info in tests
   - ✅ Solution: Use time delta comparisons
   - ✅ Standard: Follow last_contact patterns
   - 💡 Key Points:
     * SQLite stores datetime as strings
     * Comparison needs timezone context
     * Time deltas more reliable

2. Association Table Architecture
   - ❌ Current: Duplicate definitions found
   - 💡 Decision: Move to 23.6 feature branch
   - 💡 Rationale: Separate architectural concern from timezone handling
   - 🔴 Attempted Solutions:
     * Table-level events (failed: not valid for Table objects)
     * DDL events (failed: wrong event type)
     * Need relationship-level approach

3. Timestamp Strategy
   - ✅ Store all times in UTC
   - ✅ Convert on save/load
   - ✅ Use time deltas for comparisons
   - 💡 Considerations:
     * SQLite limitations
     * Relationship updates
     * Event handling
   - 🔄 Follow-up:
     * Standardize handling across models
     * Document rationale for approaches
     * Verify state change tracking

## Next Steps [23.5]
1. Create feature branch 23.6-consolidate-association-tables
   - [ ] Move association table consolidation
   - [ ] Move relationship event handling
   - [ ] Create separate DevJournal

2. Complete remaining 23.5 tasks
   - [ ] Document timezone patterns
   - [ ] Complete basic repository integration
   - [ ] Update documentation

## Status [23.5]
- Implementation: Partially blocked (relationships)
- Test Coverage: 80% (core functionality)
- Documentation: Current
- Blockers: Association table duplication (moved to 23.6)
- Next Focus: Branch 23.6 creation
