   - ✅ Timezone validation working
   - ✅ Frequency handling implemented
   - ✅ Audit fields verified
   - ✅ UTC conversion confirmed

2. Test Framework (100%)
   - ✅ Base patterns established

   - ✅ Basic tests passing
   - ✅ Association tests completed
   - ✅ Repository tests completed
   - ✅ Event tests completed

3. ORM & Repository (100%)
   - ✅ Basic model structure complete
   - ✅ Association tables consolidated
   - ✅ Event listeners implemented
   - ✅ Timezone handling verified
   - ✅ Event handling complete

### Technical Decisions [23.5]
1. SQLite Timezone Handling
   - ✅ Store all times in UTC
   - ✅ Convert on save/load
   - ✅ Repository layer handles conversion
   - 💡 SQLite's string-based storage requires explicit timezone handling
   - 💡 Centralizing conversion in repository prevents timezone drift

2. Association Table Architecture
   - ✅ Consolidated in association_tables.py via #38
   - ✅ Clean ownership and hierarchy
   - 💡 Duplicate table definitions cause SQLAlchemy relationship conflicts
   - 💡 Single source of truth prevents cascade timing issues

3. Timestamp Strategy
   - ✅ Store all times in UTC
   - ✅ Convert on save/load
   - ✅ ORM ensures UTC storage
   - 💡 Domain model must preserve original zones for business logic
   - 💡 Repository boundaries are natural timezone conversion points

4. Test Pattern Alignment
   - ✅ Follows TEST_PATTERNS.md guidelines
   - ✅ Domain-specific test structure
   - 💡 Relationship-heavy models need focused association testing
   - 💡 Standard test patterns sufficient for timezone handling

## Next Steps [23.5]
- ✅ Ready for merge into #23
- ✅ All implementation complete
- ✅ All tests passing and aligned
- ✅ Documentation updated

## Status [23.5]
- Implementation: 100% complete
- Test Coverage: 100% (all tests passing)
- Documentation: Complete
- Blockers: None
- Next Focus: Merge into #23
