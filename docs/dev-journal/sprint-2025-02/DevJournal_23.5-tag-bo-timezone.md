Version: 2025.02.18-1-feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone

## Current Focus [feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
### Parent Feature [feature/23-implement-timezone-handling]
#### Completed Components
- âœ… Tag BO: Partial implementation (last_contact field handled)
#### Active Development
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for Tag BO timezone support:
  - [ ] Domain model tests:
    - [ ] UTC conversion tests for all datetime fields
    - [ ] Timezone validation for each field type
    - [ ] DST transition handling
    - [ ] Field-specific validation rules
  - [ ] ORM model tests:
    - [ ] Database storage/retrieval with timezone
    - [ ] Column type verification
    - [ ] Relationship handling with timezone data
  - [ ] Repository tests:
    - [ ] Date range query tests
    - [ ] Frequency calculation tests
    - [ ] Bulk operation tests with timezones
    - [ ] Cross-timezone query tests
  - [ ] Integration tests:
    - [ ] Edge case scenarios
    - [ ] Integration with related BOs
    - [ ] Full workflow tests
- [ ] Complete timezone support for remaining datetime fields:
  - [ ] created_at
  - [ ] updated_at
  - [ ] frequency_last_updated
- [ ] Update Tag BO domain model with proper UTC conversion:
  - [ ] Add timezone validation
  - [ ] Implement UTC conversion logic
  - [ ] Add field-specific validation rules
- [ ] Update ORM model for Tag to utilize UTCDateTime:
  - [ ] Migrate existing fields
  - [ ] Add proper column definitions
  - [ ] Update relationship handlers
- [ ] Update Tag Repository implementation:
  - [ ] Add timezone handling in queries
  - [ ] Update find_by_date_range methods
  - [ ] Handle timezone in bulk operations
  - [ ] Update frequency-based queries

## Progress & Decisions [feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
### Implementation Status
1. Core Implementation
   - âœ… Partial Tag BO timezone support exists (last_contact handled)
   - [ ] Extend implementation to remaining datetime fields:
     * created_at/updated_at audit fields
     * frequency_last_updated field
   - [ ] Repository layer timezone handling:
     * Date range queries
     * Frequency calculations
     * Bulk operations
2. Test Framework
   - [ ] Develop tests mirroring patterns in Template, Contact, and Notes BO, as well as in the foundational patterns docs\implementation\backend\patterns\TEST_PATTERNS.md:
     * Timezone validation tests
     * UTC conversion verification
     * DST handling tests
     * Repository query tests
   - ðŸ”„ Consider edge case scenarios:
     * DST transitions
     * Timezone shifts
     * Date boundary cases
     * Cross-timezone queries

### Technical Decisions [feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
1. Architecture
   - Continue using UTCDateTime type and domain-level timezone validation
   - Align with existing patterns from Template BO
   - Ensure consistent handling across all datetime fields
   - Repository layer to handle timezone-aware queries
2. Implementation Approach
   - Review the current partial implementation
   - Validate against established test patterns and extend these test cases
   - Refactor remaining date conversions
   - Update repository query methods

   - Ensure backward compatibility

## Next Steps [feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
- âœ… Open new branch named "feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone" branching from the current branch
- [ ] Finalize requirements and design for complete Tag BO timezone support:
  - [ ] Document all affected fields
  - [ ] Define validation rules
  - [ ] Plan migration approach
  - [ ] Define repository query patterns
- [ ] Update domain and ORM models accordingly
- [ ] Update repository implementation
- [ ] Develop and run comprehensive tests
- [ ] Seek peer review and integrate feedback

## Status [feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
- Implementation: In Progress
- Test Coverage: Pending additional tests
- Documentation: Updated in this dev journal
- Blockers: None identified
- Next Focus: Complete implementation and test coverage for Tag BO timezone fields

## History [feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
### 2025.02.18-0-feature/23.5-tag-bo-timezone
- âœ… Established branch for Tag BO timezone support (last_contact field in place)
- ðŸ’¡ Observed patterns from Template and Contact BO implementations to leverage for remaining fields
- ðŸ”„ Next: Complete the remaining fields and add comprehensive tests
