   - ✅ Frequency field handling complete
   - ✅ Audit field tracking verified
   - ✅ Relationship handling fixed via #38

2. Test Implementation

   - ✅ Basic timestamp tests passing
   - ✅ Association table tests completed in #38
   - ✅ Repository timezone tests completed

3. ORM & Repository Layer
   - ✅ Basic ORM model defined
   - ✅ Association tables consolidated in #38
   - ✅ Event listeners implemented in #38
   - ✅ Basic repository integration complete
   - [ ] Event handling integration pending

## Progress & Decisions [23.5]
### Implementation Status
1. Domain Model (100%)
   - ✅ Base structure complete
   - ✅ Timezone validation working
   - ✅ Frequency handling implemented
   - ✅ Audit fields verified
   - ✅ UTC conversion confirmed

2. Test Framework (90%)
   - ✅ Base patterns established
   - ✅ SQLite timezone handling solved
   - ✅ Basic tests passing
   - ✅ Association tests completed
   - ✅ Repository tests completed
   - [ ] Event tests pending

3. ORM & Repository (80%)
   - ✅ Basic model structure complete
   - ✅ Association tables consolidated
   - ✅ Event listeners implemented
   - ✅ Timezone handling verified
   - [ ] Event handling pending

### Technical Decisions [23.5]
1. SQLite Timezone Handling
   - ✅ Pattern: Store all times in UTC
   - ✅ Solution: Convert on save/load
   - ✅ Standard: Follow last_contact patterns
   - 💡 Key Points:
     * SQLite stores datetime as strings
     * All conversions happen in repository layer
     * UTC used consistently in storage

2. Association Table Architecture
   - ✅ Consolidated in association_tables.py
   - ✅ Fixed via bugfix #38
   - ✅ Clean hierarchy established
   - 💡 Benefits:
     * No duplicate definitions
     * Clear ownership
     * Consistent patterns

3. Timestamp Strategy
   - ✅ Store all times in UTC
   - ✅ Convert on save/load
   - ✅ Use time deltas for comparisons
   - 💡 Implementation:
     * Repository handles conversion
     * ORM ensures UTC storage
     * Domain model preserves zones

## Next Steps [23.5]
1. Complete remaining tasks
   - [ ] Implement remaining event tests
   - [ ] Complete event handling integration
   - [ ] Update documentation

## Status [23.5]
- Implementation: 90% complete
- Test Coverage: 90% (timezone + repository complete)
- Documentation: Current
- Blockers: None
- Next Focus: Event handling implementation

## History [23.5]
### 2025.02.21-12
- ✅ Added repository timezone test:
  * Verified UTC storage in database
  * Tested cross-timezone conversions (Sydney/NY)
  * Confirmed timezone preservation on retrieval
- 🔄 Next: Complete remaining event tests

### 2025.02.21-11
- ✅ Ran full test suite for tag_orm
- ✅ All 9 tests passing:
  * Basic creation and validation
  * Required fields and constraints
  * Entity type validation
  * Relationship handling (contact, note, statement)
  * Association table definitions
  * Frequency and last contact tracking
  * Concurrent operations
- 💡 Minor warnings in transaction handling:
  * Related to test cleanup
  * No impact on test results or functionality
- 🔄 Next: Add event tests as noted in current focus

### 2025.02.20-10
- ✅ Fixed concurrent tag operations test
- ✅ Verified SQLite threading limitations
- 💡 Implemented sequential transaction approach:
  * Each tag operation in separate transaction
  * Verification after each operation
  * Final state validation
- 🔄 Next: Complete remaining association tests

### 2025.02.20-9
- ✅ Cleaned up next steps after #38 merge
- 💡 Identified remaining test gaps:
  * Association tests still needed
  * Event tests still pending
- 🔄 Next: Complete test implementation before repository integration
