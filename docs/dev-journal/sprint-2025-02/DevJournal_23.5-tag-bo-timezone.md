# Development Journal - [23.5-tag-bo-timezone]
Version: 2025.02.20-9-feat-23.5

## Current Focus [23.5]
### Tag BO Timezone Implementation
- 🔄 Complete remaining test implementation:
  * Association tests needed
  * Event tests pending

### Active Tasks
1. Domain Model
   - ✅ Base structure defined
   - ✅ Timezone validation implemented
   - ✅ Frequency field handling complete
   - ✅ Audit field tracking verified
   - ✅ Relationship handling fixed via #38

2. Test Implementation
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - ✅ SQLite timezone patterns established
   - ✅ Basic timestamp tests passing
   - ✅ Association table tests completed in #38
   - ✅ Relationship event tests completed in #38

3. ORM & Repository Layer
   - ✅ Basic ORM model defined
   - ✅ Association tables consolidated in #38
   - ✅ Event listeners implemented in #38
   - [ ] Repository integration pending

## Progress & Decisions [23.5]
### Implementation Status
1. Domain Model (100%)
   - ✅ Base structure complete
   - ✅ Timezone validation working
   - ✅ Frequency handling implemented
   - ✅ Audit fields verified
   - ✅ UTC conversion confirmed

2. Test Framework (80%)
   - ✅ Base patterns established
   - ✅ SQLite timezone handling solved
   - ✅ Basic tests passing
   - [ ] Association tests needed
   - [ ] Event tests pending

3. ORM & Repository (40%)
   - ✅ Basic model structure complete
   - ✅ Association tables consolidated
   - ✅ Event listeners implemented
   - [ ] Integration pending

### Technical Decisions [23.5]
1. SQLite Timezone Handling
   - ✅ Pattern: Strip timezone info in tests
   - ✅ Solution: Use time delta comparisons
   - ✅ Standard: Follow last_contact patterns
   - 💡 Key Points:
     * SQLite stores datetime as strings
     * Comparison needs timezone context
     * Time deltas more reliable

2. Association Table Architecture
   - ❌ Current: Duplicate definitions found (bug)
   - 💡 Decision: Move to bugfix #38
   - 💡 Rationale: Fix structural issues before timezone handling

3. Timestamp Strategy
   - ✅ Store all times in UTC
   - ✅ Convert on save/load
   - ✅ Use time deltas for comparisons
   - 💡 Considerations:
     * SQLite limitations
     * Relationship updates
     * Event handling
   - 🔄 Follow-up:
     * Standardize handling across models
     * Document rationale for approaches
     * Verify state change tracking

## Next Steps [23.5]
1. Complete remaining 23.5 tasks
   - [ ] Document timezone patterns
   - [ ] Complete basic repository integration
   - [ ] Update documentation

## Status [23.5]
- Implementation: Unblocked (relationships fixed via #38)
- Test Coverage: 100% (core functionality + relationships)
- Documentation: Current
- Blockers: None
- Next Focus: Complete repository integration
