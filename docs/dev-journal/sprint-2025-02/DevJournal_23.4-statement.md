# Development Journal - [23.4-statement-component]
Version: 2025.02.18-3-feat-23.4

## Current Focus [23.4]
### Statement Component Implementation
- ✅ Initial setup complete
- ✅ Timezone handling analysis complete
- ✅ Test pattern application started
- ✅ Tag cleanup behavior verified
- Component structure setup

### Active Tasks
1. Domain Model
   - ✅ Base structure defined
   - Statement entity definition
   - ✅ Timezone handling verified (inherits from BaseModel)
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior implemented
   - Validation rules setup

2. Test Implementation
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - ✅ Statement-specific tests implemented
   - ✅ Edge case coverage implemented
   - ✅ Tag cleanup tests passing
   - Integration test setup

3. ORM & Repository Layer
   - ✅ ORM model defined in StatementORM
   - ✅ Repository operations integrated in NoteRepository
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior verified
   - [ ] ORM layer tests in test_note.py
   - [ ] Repository layer tests in test_note_repository.py

## Progress & Decisions [23.4]
### Implementation Status
1. Domain Model (45%)
   - ✅ Base structure defined
   - ✅ Initial fields mapped
   - ✅ Timezone handling verified
   - ✅ Audit fields confirmed
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior implemented

2. Test Framework (65%)
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - ✅ Pattern application completed
   - ✅ Statement tests implemented:
     * Timestamp handling
     * Sequence preservation
     * Content validation
     * Tag cleanup behavior
   - ✅ All existing tests passing
   - Coverage goals set

3. ORM & Repository (35%)
   - ✅ ORM model structure complete
   - ✅ Repository operations defined
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior verified
   - Missing test coverage:
     * Statement sequence handling in ORM
     * Statement tag persistence
     * Statement cascade behavior
     * Repository statement operations

### Technical Decisions [23.4]
1. Component Structure
   - ✅ Pattern selection complete
   - ✅ Field structure defined
   - ✅ Timezone handling inherited from BaseModel
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior implemented
   - Validation integration

2. Test Organization
   - ✅ Pattern selection complete
   - ✅ Using common patterns
   - ✅ Edge case tests implemented
   - ✅ Tag cleanup tests passing
   - Integration coverage

3. Architectural Analysis
   - Statement confirmed as part of Note aggregate
   - Not an independent aggregate root
   - Lifecycle managed within Note context
   - Follows DDD aggregate patterns
   - ✅ Inherits timezone handling from BaseModel
   - ✅ Tag cleanup follows proper cascade behavior
   - ✅ No separate repository needed (part of Note)

4. Tag Management Implementation
   - Statement tags managed through statement_tags join table
   - Tag cleanup only removes associations, not the tags themselves
   - Tags preserved in database for reuse by other entities
   - Cascade delete implemented at join table level
   - Follows SQLAlchemy many-to-many best practices

5. Test Strategy
   - ✅ Statement tests integrated in Note tests
   - ✅ Leverage existing test structure
   - ✅ Statement-specific scenarios added:
     * ✅ Timestamp handling in UTC
     * ✅ Sequence preservation
     * ✅ Content validation edge cases
     * ✅ Tag cleanup behavior
   - ✅ Missing coverage addressed:
     * ✅ Timezone handling for audit fields
     * ✅ Sequence management edge cases
     * ✅ Tag relationship scenarios
     * ✅ Content validation rules
   - Pending ORM/Repository tests:
     * Statement sequence persistence
     * Tag relationship persistence
     * Cascade delete behavior
     * Statement update tracking

6. Implementation Plan
   - ✅ Enhanced Note tests with Statement scenarios
   - ✅ Verified timezone-aware audit fields
   - ✅ Added comprehensive validation rules
   - ✅ Enhanced tag relationship handling
   - ✅ Implemented proper tag cleanup
   - Add ORM/Repository tests:
     * Statement sequence handling
     * Tag relationship persistence
     * Cascade operations
     * Update tracking
