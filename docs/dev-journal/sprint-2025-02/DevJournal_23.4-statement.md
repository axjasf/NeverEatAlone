# Development Journal - [23.4-statement-component]
Version: 2025.02.17-1-feat-23.4

## Current Focus [23.4]
### Statement Component Implementation
- ✅ Initial setup complete
- Timezone handling integration
- Test pattern application
- Component structure setup

### Active Tasks
1. Domain Model
   - ✅ Base structure defined
   - Statement entity definition
   - Timezone field implementation
   - Validation rules setup

2. Test Implementation
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - Test pattern application
   - Edge case coverage planning
   - Integration test setup

## Progress & Decisions [23.4]
### Implementation Status
1. Domain Model (20%)
   - ✅ Base structure defined
   - ✅ Initial fields mapped
   - Timezone handling planned

2. Test Framework (15%)
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - Pattern application started
   - Coverage goals set

### Technical Decisions [23.4]
1. Component Structure
   - ✅ Pattern selection complete
   - ✅ Field structure defined
   - Timezone-aware fields
   - Validation integration

2. Test Organization
   - ✅ Pattern selection complete
   - Using common patterns
   - Edge case focus
   - Integration coverage

3. Architectural Analysis
   - Statement confirmed as part of Note aggregate
   - Not an independent aggregate root
   - Lifecycle managed within Note context
   - Follows DDD aggregate patterns

4. Test Strategy
   - Statement tests integrated in Note tests
   - Leverage existing test structure
   - Add Statement-specific scenarios
   - Missing coverage identified:
     * Timezone handling for audit fields
     * Sequence management edge cases
     * Tag relationship scenarios
     * Content validation rules

5. Implementation Plan
   - Enhance existing Note tests with Statement scenarios
   - Implement timezone-aware audit fields
   - Add comprehensive validation rules
   - Enhance tag relationship handling

## Next Steps [23.4]
