   - ✅ Statement entity definition
   - ✅ Timezone handling verified (inherits from BaseModel)
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior implemented
   - ✅ Validation rules implemented

2. Test Implementation
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - ✅ Statement-specific tests implemented
   - ✅ Edge case coverage implemented
   - ✅ Tag cleanup tests passing
   - [ ] Repository integration tests

3. ORM & Repository Layer
   - ✅ ORM model defined in StatementORM
   - ✅ Repository operations integrated in NoteRepository
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior verified
   - [ ] Repository layer tests in test_note_repository.py
   - [ ] Repository integration tests

## Progress & Decisions [23.4]
### Implementation Status
1. Domain Model (100%)
   - ✅ Base structure defined
   - ✅ Initial fields mapped
   - ✅ Timezone handling verified
   - ✅ Audit fields confirmed
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior implemented
   - ✅ Validation rules complete

2. Test Framework (80%)
   - ✅ Test structure defined
   - ✅ Pattern application completed
   - ✅ Statement tests implemented:
     * Timestamp handling
     * Sequence preservation
     * Content validation
     * Tag cleanup behavior
   - ✅ All existing tests passing
   - [ ] Repository integration tests pending

3. ORM & Repository (50%)
   - ✅ ORM model structure complete
   - ✅ Repository operations defined
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior verified
   - Next focus:
     * Repository integration tests
     * Statement sequence handling in repository
     * Statement update tracking in repository

### Technical Decisions [23.4]
1. Component Structure
   - ✅ Pattern selection complete
   - ✅ Field structure defined
   - ✅ Timezone handling inherited from BaseModel
   - ✅ Tag cleanup behavior implemented
   - Validation integration

2. Test Organization
   - ✅ Pattern selection complete
   - ✅ Using common patterns
   - ✅ Edge case tests implemented
   - ✅ Tag cleanup tests passing
   - Integration coverage

3. Architectural Analysis
   - Statement confirmed as part of Note aggregate
   - Not an independent aggregate root
   - Lifecycle managed within Note context
   - Follows DDD aggregate patterns
   - ✅ Inherits timezone handling from BaseModel
   - ✅ Tag cleanup follows proper cascade behavior
   - ✅ No separate repository needed (part of Note)

4. Tag Management Implementation
   - Statement tags managed through statement_tags join table
   - Tag cleanup only removes associations, not the tags themselves
   - Tags preserved in database for reuse by other entities
   - Cascade delete implemented at join table level
   - Follows SQLAlchemy many-to-many best practices

5. Timestamp Precision Decision
   - Standardized timestamp comparison to second-level precision
   - Microsecond differences in statement timestamps ignored in tests
   - Aligns with business requirements (no microsecond precision needed)
   - Matches existing timestamp handling patterns in codebase
   - More robust test approach for statement lifecycle verification

6. Test Strategy
   - ✅ Statement tests integrated in Note tests
   - ✅ Leverage existing test structure
   - ✅ Statement-specific scenarios added:
     * ✅ Timestamp handling in UTC
     * ✅ Sequence preservation
     * ✅ Content validation edge cases
     * ✅ Tag cleanup behavior
   - ✅ Missing coverage addressed:
     * ✅ Timezone handling for audit fields
     * ✅ Sequence management edge cases
     * ✅ Tag relationship scenarios
     * ✅ Content validation rules
   - Repository tests next:
     * Statement sequence persistence
     * Statement lifecycle in repository
     * Repository integration patterns
     * Update tracking verification

7. Implementation Plan
   - ✅ Enhanced Note tests with Statement scenarios
   - ✅ Verified timezone-aware audit fields
   - ✅ Added comprehensive validation rules
   - ✅ Enhanced tag relationship handling
   - ✅ Implemented proper tag cleanup
   - Next phase:
     * Repository integration tests
     * Statement lifecycle tests
     * Update tracking verification
     * Performance verification
