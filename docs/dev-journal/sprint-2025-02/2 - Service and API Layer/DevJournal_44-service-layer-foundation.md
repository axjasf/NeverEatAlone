# Development Journal - [44-Service-Layer-Foundation]
Version: 2024.02.24-5-service-layer

## Status Summary
- Phase: Implementation (Base Service Complete)
- Progress: Ready for Contact Service Phase
- Quality: Green (All tests passing)
- Risks: None (Core functionality verified)
- Dependencies: Data Model Layer complete

## Current Focus
### Completed Milestones
✅ CR-44 version 1.0 defined and implemented
✅ Base Service implementation (Issue #45)
✅ Design documentation complete
✅ Test infrastructure established

### Active Challenges
None - Base implementation phase complete

### Critical Dependencies
✅ Data Model Layer
✅ Repository patterns
[ ] Contact Service design (Next phase)

## Next Steps
1. Contact Service Implementation (CR-44)
   [ ] Design contact service patterns
   [ ] Write contact service tests
   [ ] Implement contact service using TDD

2. Documentation Integration
   [ ] Update OVERVIEW.md with implemented patterns
   [ ] Document contact service design
   [ ] Review parked features list

3. Future Considerations 🔄
   🔄 Error retry patterns (Issue #45)
   🔄 Cross-service pattern standardization
   🔄 Complex error scenarios

## Technical Progress
### Implementation Status
✅ Base Service Layer complete
  - Core transaction management
  - Error handling with timestamps
  - Session lifecycle
  - Test infrastructure
  See: [DevJournal_45-base-service-implementation.md#technical-progress]

### Documentation Status
✅ CR-44 v1.0 complete
✅ Design docs implemented
✅ Base patterns documented
[ ] Contact service pending

### Parked Features (⏸️ Issue #45)
- Advanced logging (structured, timing)
- Complex error features (metadata, tracking)
- Advanced documentation
See: DevJournal_45-base-service-implementation.md#parked-features

## Technical Decisions
### Core Patterns ✅
💡 Service layer coordinates multi-step operations
💡 Transaction boundaries key for data consistency
💡 UTC timestamps essential for error tracking
💡 Error messages include type and context

### Architecture Decisions ✅
💡 Clear separation: domain logic vs. coordination logic
💡 Simple transaction management for single-user context
💡 Error handling at service boundaries

### Evolution Points 🔄
🔄 Error retry patterns (Issue #45)
🔄 Cross-service pattern standardization
🔄 Complex error scenarios (when needed)

## History
