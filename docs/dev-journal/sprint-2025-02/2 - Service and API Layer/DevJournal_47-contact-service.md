### Implementation Planning
[✅] Test structure setup
[ ] Basic operations implementation
[ ] Error handling patterns

## Next Steps
1. [✅] Review existing model
   - [✅] Contact model exists at backend/app/models/domain/contact_model.py with:
     - Integrated Note functionality (add_note, record_interaction)
     - Integrated Tag functionality (add_tags, remove_tags)
   - [✅] ContactService created in backend/app/services

2. [✅] Create test infrastructure
   - [✅] Set up test directory structure
   - [✅] Implement test fixtures from CR-48 plan
   - [✅] Set up mock patterns for external dependencies

3. [ ] Implement core operations (TDD)
   - [ ] Create contact with tags [FR1.1.1, FR1.1.2]
   - [ ] Update contact details [FR1.1.3]
   - [ ] Delete contact [FR1.3.2]
   - [ ] Search contacts [FR1.3.3]

4. [ ] Update service layer documentation
   - [ ] [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Document transaction patterns
   - [ ] [OVERVIEW.md] Update implementation status
   - [ ] [CR-2025.02-44.md] Document progress

## Technical Progress
### Implementation Status
✅ Design document reviewed
✅ Interface patterns validated

    - [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Component design
    - [SERVICE_BASE.md] Pattern consistency
[ ] Documentation update points identified
💡 Need to track documentation changes with implementation
🔄 Consider documentation-first approach for complex changes

### Test Status
✅ Test strategy reviewed
✅ Test structure created
✅ Test fixtures implemented
[ ] Test cases pending implementation
💡 Will follow BaseService test patterns
🔄 Consider adding performance tests later

## Technical Decisions
✅ Validate BaseService patterns fit
✅ Verify transaction boundaries
✅ Review error hierarchies
✅ Fixed ContactORM registration in ORM package
💡 Keep implementation focused on essential features
🔄 Complex operations deferred to future
💡 Documentation updates tied to implementation phases
