# Development Journal - [feature/47-contact-service-implementation]
Version: 2025.02.25-5-contact-service

## Status Summary
- Phase: Design
- Progress: On Track
- Quality: Green (core requirements validated)
- Risks:
  - Design patterns need validation against real use cases
  - Integration with existing domain models needs verification
  - Documentation consistency across service layer
- Dependencies:
  - âœ… [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_BASE.md]
  - âœ… CR-44 Base Service implementation
  - âœ… CR-48 Core CRUD Requirements Refinement

## Current Focus
### Documentation Structure
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Initial design
  - âœ… Core features defined
  - âœ… Requirement IDs mapped
  - âœ… Interface patterns implemented
  - [ ] Interface patterns validated

[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Service layer patterns
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/OVERVIEW.md] Feature documentation
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/crs/CR-2024.02-44.md] CR update

### Implementation Planning
[ ] Test structure setup
[ ] Basic operations implementation
[ ] Error handling patterns

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Validate interface patterns
   - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Review error handling scenarios
   - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Verify transaction boundaries
   - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Check BaseService pattern alignment

2. [ ] Create test infrastructure
   - [ ] Set up test directory structure
   - [ ] Implement test fixtures from CR-48 plan
   - [ ] Set up mock patterns for external dependencies

3. [ ] Implement core operations (TDD)
   - [ ] Create contact with tags [FR1.1.1, FR1.1.2]
   - [ ] Update contact details [FR1.1.3]
   - [ ] Delete contact [FR1.3.2]
   - [ ] Search contacts [FR1.3.3]

4. [ ] Update service layer documentation
   - [ ] [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Document transaction patterns
   - [ ] [OVERVIEW.md] Update implementation status
   - [ ] [CR-2024.02-44.md] Document progress

## Technical Progress
### Implementation Status
âœ… Design document reviewed
[ ] Interface patterns need validation
[ ] Test infrastructure pending
[ ] Implementation pending

### Documentation Status
[ ] Initial review of affected docs:
    - [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Layer relationships
    - [OVERVIEW.md] Feature scope and status
    - [CR-2024.02-44.md] Implementation tracking
    - [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Component design
    - [SERVICE_BASE.md] Pattern consistency
[ ] Documentation update points identified
ðŸ’¡ Need to track documentation changes with implementation
ðŸ”„ Consider documentation-first approach for complex changes

### Test Status
[ ] Test strategy needs review
[ ] Test structure pending
ðŸ’¡ Will follow BaseService test patterns
ðŸ”„ Consider adding performance tests later

## Technical Decisions
[ ] Validate BaseService patterns fit
[ ] Verify transaction boundaries
[ ] Review error hierarchies
ðŸ’¡ Keep implementation focused on essential features
ðŸ”„ Complex operations deferred to future
ðŸ’¡ Documentation updates tied to implementation phases

## History
### 2025.02.25-5-contact-service
- âœ… Implemented BaseService patterns for all methods
- âœ… Added consistent error handling
- âœ… Added transaction boundaries
- âœ… Added operation logging
- ðŸ’¡ Next: Validate against BaseService requirements

### 2025.02.25-4-contact-service
- âœ… Added BaseService patterns to interface design
- âœ… Updated error handling structure
- âœ… Added transaction context examples

### 2025.02.25-3-contact-service
- ðŸ”¹ Merged CR-48: Core CRUD requirements documented
- âœ… Requirements mapping completed
- âœ… Test coverage plan defined
- ðŸ’¡ Ready for interface pattern validation

### 2025.02.24-2-contact-service
- ðŸ’¡ Identified missing explicit CRUD requirements
- âœ… Created CR-48 to document core CRUD requirements
- ðŸ”µ Created branch for CR-48 implementation
- ðŸ”„ Will need to update requirement IDs after CR-48 completion

### 2025.02.24-1-contact-service
- âœ… [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Created initial design doc
- âœ… [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Defined preliminary features
- âœ… [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Outlined test strategy
- ðŸ’¡ Starting with minimal scope
- ðŸ’¡ Identified documentation dependencies
- ðŸ”„ Noted potential future enhancements
