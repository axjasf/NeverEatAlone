# Development Journal - [feature/47-contact-service-implementation]
Version: 2025.02.24-2-contact-service

## Status Summary
- Phase: Initial Design
- Progress: Starting
- Quality: Yellow (design needs validation)
- Risks:
  - Design patterns need validation against real use cases
  - Integration with existing domain models needs verification
  - Documentation consistency across service layer
  - Missing explicit CRUD requirements identified (CR-48)
- Dependencies:
  - âœ… [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_BASE.md]
  - âœ… CR-44 Base Service implementation
  - [ ] CR-48 Core CRUD Requirements Refinement

## Current Focus
### Documentation Structure
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Initial design
  - âœ… Core features defined
  - [ ] Requirement IDs mapped (pending CR-48)
  - [ ] Interface patterns validated
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Service layer patterns
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/OVERVIEW.md] Feature documentation
[ ] [docs/features/2-service-layer/crs/CR-2024.02-44.md] CR update

### Implementation Planning
[ ] Test structure setup
[ ] Basic operations implementation
[ ] Error handling patterns

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Review and validate design
   - [ ] Wait for CR-48 completion before finalizing requirement IDs
   - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Review core features
   - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Validate interface patterns
   - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Refine error scenarios

2. [ ] Update core documentation
   - [ ] [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Update layer relationships
   - [ ] [OVERVIEW.md] Update feature status
   - [ ] [CR-2024.02-44.md] Document implementation progress
   - [ ] [SERVICE_BASE.md] Review for pattern consistency

3. [ ] Create test infrastructure
   - [ ] Test file structure
   - [ ] Common test fixtures
   - [ ] Mock patterns

4. [ ] Implement core operations (TDD)
   - [ ] Create contact with tags
   - [ ] Update contact details
   - [ ] Basic error handling

5. [ ] Documentation updates (per workflow guide)
   - On pattern discovery:
     - [ ] [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Layer interactions
     - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Implementation patterns
   - On component completion:
     - [ ] [OVERVIEW.md] Feature status
     - [ ] [CR-2024.02-44.md] Progress update
     - [ ] [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Final patterns

## Technical Progress
### Implementation Status
[ ] Design document needs review
[ ] Interface patterns need validation
[ ] Test infrastructure pending
[ ] Implementation pending

### Documentation Status
[ ] Initial review of affected docs:
    - [SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md] Layer relationships
    - [OVERVIEW.md] Feature scope and status
    - [CR-2024.02-44.md] Implementation tracking
    - [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Component design
    - [SERVICE_BASE.md] Pattern consistency
[ ] Documentation update points identified
ðŸ’¡ Need to track documentation changes with implementation
ðŸ”„ Consider documentation-first approach for complex changes

### Test Status
[ ] Test strategy needs review
[ ] Test structure pending
ðŸ’¡ Will follow BaseService test patterns
ðŸ”„ Consider adding performance tests later

## Technical Decisions
[ ] Validate BaseService patterns fit
[ ] Verify transaction boundaries
[ ] Review error hierarchies
ðŸ’¡ Keep implementation focused on essential features
ðŸ”„ Complex operations deferred to future
ðŸ’¡ Documentation updates tied to implementation phases

## History
### 2025.02.24-2-contact-service
- ðŸ’¡ Identified missing explicit CRUD requirements
- âœ… Created CR-48 to document core CRUD requirements
- ðŸ”µ Created branch for CR-48 implementation
- ðŸ”„ Will need to update requirement IDs after CR-48 completion

### 2025.02.24-1-contact-service
- âœ… [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Created initial design doc
- âœ… [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Defined preliminary features
- âœ… [SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Outlined test strategy
- ðŸ’¡ Starting with minimal scope
- ðŸ’¡ Identified documentation dependencies
- ðŸ”„ Noted potential future enhancements
