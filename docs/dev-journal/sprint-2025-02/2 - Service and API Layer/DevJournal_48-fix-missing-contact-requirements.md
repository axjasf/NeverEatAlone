## Status Summary
- Phase: Requirements Documentation

- Quality: Yellow (requirements need validation)
- Risks:
  - Impact on existing test coverage needs assessment
  - Potential gaps in other CRUD operations not yet identified
  - Backward compatibility with existing documentation
- Dependencies:
  - âœ… [docs/features/2-service-layer/design/SERVICE_CONTACT.md] Initial design
  - âœ… CR-44 Service Layer Foundation
  - âœ… [docs/brd/modules/contact_management/requirements/functional.md] Current requirements

## Current Focus
### Documentation Structure
[âœ…] [docs/brd/modules/contact_management/requirements/functional.md] Add core operations

  - [ ] Test coverage alignment

### Requirements Analysis
âœ… Review existing implicit requirements
âœ… Validate requirement numbering scheme
âœ… Update service design with new requirement IDs

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Update test coverage plan
   - [ ] Add test cases for FR1.3.1 (get_by_id)
   - [ ] Add test cases for FR1.3.2 (delete)
   - [ ] Add test cases for FR1.3.3 (search)

2. [ ] Documentation validation
   - [ ] Cross-reference check
   - [ ] Consistency review
   - [ ] Impact assessment

## Technical Progress
### Documentation Status
âœ… Requirements document updated with section 1.3
âœ… Service design updated with requirement IDs
[ ] Test coverage plan pending

ðŸ”„ Consider impact on future requirements

### Validation Status
âœ… Requirements completeness check done
âœ… Numbering scheme validated
âœ… Interface documentation updated
[ ] Test coverage plan needed
ðŸ’¡ Focus on explicit vs implicit requirements
ðŸ”„ Consider template for future CRUD operations

## Technical Decisions
âœ… Requirements structure and placement
âœ… Numbering scheme continuation
âœ… Interface design for search operation
[ ] Test strategy
ðŸ’¡ Keep requirements atomic and testable
ðŸ”„ Consider template for other service requirements
