# Development Journal - [branch/45-base-service-implementation]
Version: 2025.02.24-2-base-service

## Status Summary
- Branch: feature/45-base-service-implementation
- Phase: Implementation (TDD Green → Essential Refactor)
- Parent: CR-44 Service Layer Foundation
- Dependencies: None (first implementation branch)

## Current Focus
### Implementation Progress
✅ Test Infrastructure
  - Test structure matches repository pattern
  - Mock approach verified
  - Session factory pattern working

✅ Base Service Tests (Green Phase)
  - Transaction context tests passing
  - Error handling tests passing
  - Session lifecycle tests passing

✅ Base Service Implementation
  - Core class structure
  - Transaction context manager
  - Error hierarchy
  - Basic logging integration

### Next Steps (Essential Refactor)
[ ] Critical Test Coverage
   - Add test: commit failure handling
   - Add test: rollback failure handling
   - Add test: timestamp verification

[ ] Essential Error Enhancement
   - Add timestamp to ServiceError
   - Update error message formatting
   - Update tests to verify timestamps

[ ] Documentation Update
   - Update SERVICE_BASE.md with changes
   - Document error handling patterns
   - Update test documentation

### Implementation Order
1. First Session (Today):
   [ ] Add commit failure test
   [ ] Add rollback failure test
   [ ] Implement timestamp in errors

2. Second Session:
   [ ] Update error message format
   [ ] Update existing tests
   [ ] Document changes

### Parked Features ⏸️
1. Advanced Logging Features
   ⏸️ Structured logging (planned but basic logging works)
   ⏸️ Correlation IDs (planned but not needed for single user)
   ⏸️ Operation timing (planned but not critical)

2. Complex Error Features
   ⏸️ Operation metadata (planned but basic context sufficient)
   ⏸️ Nested error scenarios (planned but simple errors work)
   ⏸️ Detailed error tracking (planned but basic tracking enough)

3. Additional Documentation
   ⏸️ Service checklist (planned but can evolve naturally)
   ⏸️ Complex patterns (planned but can document as needed)
   ⏸️ Advanced examples (planned but basic examples sufficient)

## Technical Progress
### Implementation Status
✅ Core transaction management working
✅ Basic error hierarchy in place
✅ Session lifecycle verified
✅ Essential vs. deferrable features identified
🔄 Error retry patterns might be needed (noticed during testing)

### Test Status
✅ Basic transaction tests passing
✅ Session management tests passing
[ ] Critical failure tests pending
🔄 Might need more complex error scenarios (uncovered in review)

## Technical Decisions
✅ Keep error context simple but extensible
✅ Use basic logging for now
💡 Transaction boundaries are key for data consistency
🔄 Error context enrichment might be needed (noticed in testing)
