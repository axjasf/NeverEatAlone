# Development Journal - [45-base-service-implementation]
Version: 2025.02.23-1-base-service

## Status Summary
- Phase: Implementation
- Progress: Starting TDD cycle
- Dependencies: CR-44 design docs complete

## Current Focus
### Base Service Tests (Red Phase)
âœ… Test structure created
âœ… Initial test cases defined:
  - Transaction context management
  - Error handling
  - Session lifecycle
[ ] Implementation pending

### Next: Base Service Implementation
Required components (per CR-44):
1. **Transaction Context**
   [ ] Context manager implementation
   [ ] Session management
   [ ] Commit/rollback handling

2. **Error Handling**
   [ ] Service error hierarchy
   [ ] Error context preservation
   [ ] Logging integration

3. **Session Management**
   [ ] Session factory integration
   [ ] Session lifecycle
   [ ] Resource cleanup

## Technical Progress
### Implementation Status
âœ… Project structure set up
  - `/backend/app/services/` directory created
  - Base service module initialized
  - Test structure established
[ ] Tests written (failing as expected)
ðŸ’¡ Using pytest fixtures for session mocking
ðŸ’¡ Following AAA pattern in tests

### Test Status
âœ… Test cases defined
[ ] Tests running (expected to fail)
ðŸ’¡ Mock session approach established
ðŸ’¡ Error scenarios identified

## Technical Decisions
ðŸ’¡ Using context manager for transaction scope
ðŸ’¡ Keeping error hierarchy simple but extensible
ðŸ’¡ Session factory approach for flexibility
ðŸ’¡ Comprehensive error context in logs
ðŸ”„ Consider adding transaction nesting later

## History
### 2025.02.23-1-base-service
âœ… Created service package structure
âœ… Added initial test cases
âœ… Set up error hierarchy
ðŸ’¡ Decided on context manager pattern for transactions
