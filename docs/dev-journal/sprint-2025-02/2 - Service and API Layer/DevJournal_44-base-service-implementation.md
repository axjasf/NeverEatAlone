Version: 2024.02.23-1-service-base

## Status Summary
- Phase: Planning
- Progress: Starting
- Quality: Green
- Risks: None
- Dependencies: Data Model Layer complete

## Current Focus
[ ] Base Service Architecture
  [ ] Service interface patterns
  [ ] Transaction boundaries
  [ ] Error handling strategy
  [ ] Event propagation

[ ] Test Infrastructure
  [ ] Service test patterns
  [ ] Transaction test helpers
  [ ] Mock strategies
  [ ] Integration test approach

[ ] Cross-Cutting Concerns
  [ ] Logging strategy
  [ ] Error translation
  [ ] Performance monitoring
  [ ] Service metrics

## Next Steps
[ ] Define base service interface template
[ ] Create transaction management approach
[ ] Establish error handling patterns
[ ] Design service test framework

## Technical Progress
### Implementation Status
[ ] Base service interface defined
[ ] Transaction boundaries established
[ ] Error handling patterns documented
ðŸ’¡ Repository patterns inform service boundaries
ðŸ’¡ Domain events needed for cross-service coordination

### Test Status
[ ] Test patterns documented
[ ] Transaction test helpers created
[ ] Mock strategies defined
ðŸ’¡ Repository tests provide good foundation

## Technical Decisions
[ ] Service interface standardization
[ ] Transaction scope management
[ ] Error handling approach
[ ] Test infrastructure design
ðŸ’¡ Keep services focused on business logic
ðŸ’¡ Use repository patterns as guide

## History
### 2024.02.23-1-service-base
- Base Service implementation started (#44)
[ ] Initial architecture planning
ðŸ’¡ Repository layer patterns inform design
