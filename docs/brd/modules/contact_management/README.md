# Contact Management Module

## Overview

The Contact Management module provides a flexible system for storing and organizing contact information, with a focus on tracking interactions at both general and topic-specific levels.

## Core Features

1. **Base Contact Information**
   - Required name field
   - Optional first name
   - Optional contact briefing text (with AI-assisted generation)
   - Last interaction tracking at two levels:
     - General last contact date for any interaction
     - Tag-specific last contact dates for topic-based tracking
   - Creation and last update timestamps

2. **Flexible Information Storage**
   - Single JSON template with categories and fields
   - Basic type validation (string, number, date)
   - Support for nested structures
   - Example fields: lived_in, preferences, relationships

3. **Contact Tracking**
   - Two types of tracking:
     - General: When was the last interaction with this contact?
     - Tag-specific: When did we last discuss specific topics?
   - Support for contentless interaction records
   - Frequency requirements per contact-tag combination
   - Example: "Talk about hobbies monthly with Grandma"

4. **Notes and Interactions**
   - Two types of notes:
     - Content notes: Actual information about the contact
     - Interaction records: Just tracking that contact happened
   - Tag-based organization
   - Automatic contact tracking updates
   - Support for topic-based interaction history

5. **Organization Features**
   - Hashtag-based categorization
   - Contact-tag frequency settings
   - Staleness tracking per topic
   - Filtering by interaction history
   - Topic-based contact grouping

6. **AI Integration**
   - Smart tag suggestions
   - Contact briefing generation
   - Interaction pattern analysis
   - Frequency recommendation

## Key Workflows

1. **Contact Creation**
   ```
   Create Contact → Add Basic Info → Define JSON Fields → Add Tags with Frequencies
   ```

2. **Recording Interactions**
   ```
   Select Contact → Record Interaction (with/without notes) → Add Topic Tags → Update Tracking
   ```

3. **Information Organization**
   ```
   Add Tags → Set Topic Frequencies → Track Interactions → Monitor Staleness
   ```

4. **Contact Updates**
   ```
   Record Interaction → Update Tracking → Optional Notes → Update Fields
   ```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Data Storage**
   - SQLite database with JSON support

   - Notes and statements tables
   - Efficient indexing for common queries

2. **AI Processing**
