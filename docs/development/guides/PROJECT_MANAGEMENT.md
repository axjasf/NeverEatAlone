# Project Management Guide

## Overview
This guide describes our project management workflow, from idea to implementation. It includes our GitHub Projects setup, Change Request (CR) process, and branching strategy.

## Project Board Structure

### Columns
1. **ðŸ“‹ Backlog**
   - New issues that are defined but not yet ready
   - Initial ideas and feature requests
   - Automatically receives new issues

2. **ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Backlog**
   - Issues selected for current sprint
   - Moved here during sprint planning
   - Fully specified and ready to work on

3. **ðŸ’» In Progress**
   - Issues actively being worked on
   - Has assigned developer
   - Has associated branch and CR

4. **ðŸ‘€ In Review**
   - PRs waiting for review
   - Issues in testing phase
   - Automatically updated by PR creation

5. **âœ… Done**
   - Completed and deployed issues
   - Automatically updated by PR merge

## Change Request (CR) Process

### CR Directory Structure
CRs are organized in `docs/implementation/changes/` to match the project board:

1. **1-backlog/**
   - CRs that are defined but not yet ready
   - Matches "Backlog" column

2. **2-sprint-backlog/**
   - CRs selected for current sprint
   - Matches "Sprint Backlog" column

3. **3-in-progress/**
   - CRs actively being worked on
   - Matches "In Progress" column

4. **4-in-review/**
   - CRs with PRs waiting for review
   - Matches "In Review" column

5. **5-done/YYYY/MM/**
   - Completed CRs by year/month
   - Matches "Done" column

### CR Creation Flow
1. Create GitHub issue
2. Create CR document from TEMPLATE.md
3. Create feature branch
4. Update Implementation Plan
5. Update Working Notes

### Example Story: Adding Timezone Support
```bash
# 1. Create issue and CR
./scripts/cr.sh create "Implement timezone handling" "Add timezone support..." "feature"

# 2. Update progress
./scripts/cr.sh update 23 "in-progress" "Started implementing TimezoneAwareBase"

# 3. Finalize CR
./scripts/cr.sh finalize 23 "CR-2024.02-23"
```

### CR Document Structure
- Issue information
- Requirements analysis
- Implementation plan
- Test plan
- Documentation updates
- Review checklist

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature: `feature/<issue-number>-<description>`
- Bugfix: `bugfix/<issue-number>-<description>`
- Documentation: `docs/<issue-number>-<description>`
- Refactor: `refactor/<issue-number>-<description>`

### Example:
```bash
# For issue #23: Implement timezone handling
git checkout -b feature/23-implement-timezone-handling
```

## Implementation Flow

### Example Story: New Feature Implementation

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create issue and CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh create "Add contact search" "Implement contact search..." "feature"
   ```

2. **Start Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Move issue to In Progress
   # Update CR status
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Starting TDD cycle for search functionality"
   ```

3. **Development Cycle**
   ```bash
   # Write tests
   # Implement feature
   # Update documentation
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-review" "Ready for code review"
   ```

4. **Completion**
   ```bash
   # After PR approval and merge
   ./scripts/cr.sh finalize 24 "CR-2025.02.17-1"
   ```

## Documentation Structure

### Core Tools
1. **GitHub Project Board**
   - Visual task tracking
   - Current status at a glance
   - Simple kanban: Backlog â†’ In Progress â†’ Done

2. **CR Documents** (`docs/implementation/changes/`)
   - One document per significant change
   - Requirements and implementation notes
   - Created via `./scripts/cr.sh create`

3. **Development Journal** (`docs/implementation/DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md`)
   - Combined implementation plan and working notes
   - Tracks current sprint progress and decisions
   - Fine-granular observations and progress tracking
   - Format:
     ```markdown
     # Development Journal
     Version: YYYY.MM.DD-N

     ## Current Focus
     What the sprint is focusing on right now

     ## What I'm Working On
     Current implementation tasks and progress

     ## Recent Progress
     Completed items and achievements

     ## Technical Decisions
     Architecture and implementation choices

     ## Next Steps
     Immediate tasks and plans

     ## Backlog
     Future work items with priorities

     ## History
     Version changelog
     ```

4. **Development Journal Management**

### Sprint Branch Workflow
1. Each sprint has a dedicated branch (`sprint/YYYY-MM`)
   - Contains the single source of truth for development journal
   - All feature branches branch from here

2. Feature Branch Process
   - Branch from current sprint branch
   - Update development journal in sprint branch
   - All progress tracked in sprint branch journal

3. Sprint Completion
   - Sprint branch merges to main
   - New sprint branch created
   - Ongoing features rebase onto new sprint branch

4. Journal Structure
   - Current Focus: What the sprint is focusing on right now
   - What I'm Working On: Current implementation tasks
   - Recent Progress: Completed items and achievements
   - Technical Decisions: Architecture and implementation choices
   - Next Steps: Immediate tasks and plans
   - Backlog: Future work items with priorities
   - History: Version changelog

### Simple Workflow
1. **Starting Work**
   ```bash
   # Create issue and CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh create "Add feature X" "Description" "feature"

   # Update journal
   # Make updates in sprint branch's DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md
   ```

2. **Progress Updates**
   - Move cards on project board
   - Update development journal with progress
   - Update CR if major milestone or major insights relevant to the CR

3. **Completing Work**
   ```bash
   # Finalize CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh finalize <issue-number> <cr-number>

   # Add completion to journal
   # Document completion in sprint branch's DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md
   ```

## Best Practices

### Issue Management
1. **Creation**
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed description
   - Appropriate labels
   - Linked to CR when applicable

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Regular status updates
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Documentation kept up to date

3. **Completion**
   - All tests passing
   - Documentation updated
   - CR finalized
   - PR reviewed and merged

### Example: Full Feature Lifecycle

Let's follow a complete example of implementing a new feature:

1. **Feature Inception**
   ```
   Idea: We need contact search functionality
   ```

2. **Issue Creation**
   ```
   Title: Implement contact search
   Description: Add ability to search contacts by name and tags
   Label: feature
   ```

3. **CR Creation**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cr.sh create "Implement contact search" "Add search..." "feature"
   # Creates:
   # - Issue #24
   # - CR-2025.02.17-1
   # - Branch feature/24-implement-contact-search
   ```

4. **Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Start work
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Starting implementation"

   # Regular updates
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Completed search API"
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Added UI components"

   # Ready for review
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-review" "Ready for testing"
   ```

5. **Completion**
   ```bash
   # After successful review and merge
   ./scripts/cr.sh finalize 24 "CR-2025.02.17-1"
   ```
