# Project Management Guide

## Overview
This guide describes our project management workflow, from idea to implementation. It includes our GitHub Projects setup, Change Request (CR) process, and branching strategy.

## Project Board Structure

### Columns
1. **ðŸ“‹ Backlog**
   - New issues that are defined but not yet ready
   - Initial ideas and feature requests
   - Automatically receives new issues

2. **ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Backlog**
   - Issues selected for current sprint
   - Moved here during sprint planning
   - Fully specified and ready to work on

3. **ðŸ’» In Progress**
   - Issues actively being worked on
   - Has assigned developer
   - Has associated branch and CR

4. **ðŸ‘€ In Review**
   - PRs waiting for review
   - Issues in testing phase
   - Automatically updated by PR creation

5. **âœ… Done**
   - Completed and deployed issues
   - Automatically updated by PR merge

## Change Request (CR) Process

### CR Directory Structure
CRs are organized in `docs/implementation/changes/` to match the project board:

1. **1-backlog/**
   - CRs that are defined but not yet ready
   - Matches "Backlog" column

2. **2-sprint-backlog/**
   - CRs selected for current sprint
   - Matches "Sprint Backlog" column

3. **3-in-progress/**
   - CRs actively being worked on
   - Matches "In Progress" column

4. **4-in-review/**
   - CRs with PRs waiting for review
   - Matches "In Review" column

5. **5-done/YYYY/MM/**
   - Completed CRs by year/month
   - Matches "Done" column

### CR Creation Flow
1. Create GitHub issue
2. Create CR document from TEMPLATE.md
3. Create feature branch
4. Update Implementation Plan
5. Update Working Notes

### Example Story: Adding Timezone Support
```bash
# 1. Create issue and CR
./scripts/cr.sh create "Implement timezone handling" "Add timezone support..." "feature"

# 2. Update progress
./scripts/cr.sh update 23 "in-progress" "Started implementing TimezoneAwareBase"

# 3. Finalize CR
./scripts/cr.sh finalize 23 "CR-2024.02-23"
```

### CR Document Structure
- Issue information
- Requirements analysis
- Implementation plan
- Test plan
- Documentation updates
- Review checklist

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature: `feature/<issue-number>-<description>`
- Bugfix: `bugfix/<issue-number>-<description>`
- Documentation: `docs/<issue-number>-<description>`
- Refactor: `refactor/<issue-number>-<description>`

### Example:
```bash
# For issue #23: Implement timezone handling
git checkout -b feature/23-implement-timezone-handling
```

## Implementation Flow

### Example Story: New Feature Implementation

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create issue and CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh create "Add contact search" "Implement contact search..." "feature"
   ```

2. **Start Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Move issue to In Progress
   # Update CR status
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Starting TDD cycle for search functionality"
   ```

3. **Development Cycle**
   ```bash
   # Write tests
   # Implement feature
   # Update documentation
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-review" "Ready for code review"
   ```

4. **Completion**
   ```bash
   # After PR approval and merge
   ./scripts/cr.sh finalize 24 "CR-2025.02.17-1"
   ```

## Documentation Structure

### Core Tools
1. **GitHub Project Board**
   - Visual task tracking
   - Current status at a glance
   - Simple kanban: Backlog â†’ In Progress â†’ Done

2. **CR Documents** (`docs/implementation/changes/`)
   - One document per significant change
   - Requirements and implementation notes
   - Created via `./scripts/cr.sh create`

3. **Development Journals** (`docs/dev-journal/`)
   - Sprint-based organization
   - Feature and sub-feature tracking
   - Progress and decision documentation
   - Structure:
     ```
     dev-journal/
     â”œâ”€â”€ sprint-YYYY-MM/              # Sprint folders
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DevJournal_Sprint-*.md   # Sprint overview
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DevJournal_*.md          # Feature journals
     â””â”€â”€ future-YYYY-QN/              # Future planning
         â””â”€â”€ DevJournal_Future-*.md   # Future plans
     ```

4. **Development Journal Management**

### Sprint-Based Journal Workflow
1. Each sprint has a dedicated folder (`sprint-YYYY-MM/`)
   - Contains sprint overview journal
   - Contains all feature journals for the sprint
   - Matches sprint branch structure

2. Feature Journal Process
   - Created in current sprint folder
   - Tracks feature-specific progress
   - Links to sprint overview journal
   - Follows feature branch lifecycle

3. Sprint Completion
   - Archive sprint folder when complete
   - Move ongoing features to new sprint
   - Create new sprint folder and journals

4. Journal Types and Structure
   - Sprint Journals: Overview and roll-up of sprint progress
   - Feature Journals: Detailed feature implementation tracking
   - Sub-feature Journals: Component-level progress
   - Future Planning: Upcoming sprint and feature planning

### Simple Workflow
1. **Starting Work**
   ```bash
   # Create issue and CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh create "Add feature X" "Description" "feature"

   # Create feature journal in current sprint folder
   # Update sprint overview journal
   ```

2. **Progress Updates**
   - Move cards on project board
   - Update feature journal with progress
   - Update sprint journal with major milestones
   - Update CR if major milestone or insights relevant to the CR

3. **Completing Work**
   ```bash
   # Finalize CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh finalize <issue-number> <cr-number>

   # Mark completion in feature journal
   # Update sprint journal with completion
   ```

## Best Practices

### Issue Management
1. **Creation**
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed description
   - Appropriate labels
   - Linked to CR when applicable

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Regular status updates
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Documentation kept up to date

3. **Completion**
   - All tests passing
   - Documentation updated
   - CR finalized
   - PR reviewed and merged

### Example: Full Feature Lifecycle

Let's follow a complete example of implementing a new feature:

1. **Feature Inception**
   ```
   Idea: We need contact search functionality
   ```

2. **Issue Creation**
   ```
   Title: Implement contact search
   Description: Add ability to search contacts by name and tags
   Label: feature
   ```

3. **CR Creation**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cr.sh create "Implement contact search" "Add search..." "feature"
   # Creates:
   # - Issue #24
   # - CR-2025.02.17-1
   # - Branch feature/24-implement-contact-search
   ```

4. **Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Start work
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Starting implementation"

   # Regular updates
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Completed search API"
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-progress" "Added UI components"

   # Ready for review
   ./scripts/cr.sh update 24 "in-review" "Ready for testing"
   ```

5. **Completion**
   ```bash
   # After successful review and merge
   ./scripts/cr.sh finalize 24 "CR-2025.02.17-1"
   ```

## Pattern Evolution Process

### Overview
Pattern evolution occurs when we discover better ways to implement or test features. This process ensures improvements are systematically applied across the codebase.

### Pattern Discovery Flow
1. **Discovery and Documentation**
   ```bash
   # 1. Document new pattern
   ./scripts/cr.sh update <cr-number> "in-progress" "Discovered improved pattern for <area>"

   # 2. Update pattern guide
   # Example: Update TEST_PATTERNS.md with new test pattern
   ```

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Identify affected components
   - Assess urgency:
     - High: Security/correctness issues
     - Medium: Significant improvements
     - Low: Style/readability improvements
   - Create backport tasks
   - Set timeline for consistency

3. **Implementation Planning**
   ```bash
   # Create backport CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh create "Backport <pattern> to existing components" "..." "refactor"

   # Link to original CR
   ./scripts/cr.sh link <original-cr> <backport-cr>
   ```

### Pattern Consistency Checks

#### Regular Reviews
1. **Sprint Planning**
   - Review pattern consistency status
   - Prioritize critical pattern alignments
   - Schedule pattern alignment sprints

2. **Code Review**
   - Check for pattern adherence
   - Identify pattern deviations
   - Document new pattern discoveries

3. **Automated Checks**
   - Pattern violation detection
   - Test coverage for pattern requirements
   - Pattern consistency metrics

#### Example: Test Pattern Evolution
```bash
# 1. Pattern Discovery
./scripts/cr.sh update 23 "in-progress" "Discovered better timezone test patterns"

# 2. Document Pattern
# Update TEST_PATTERNS.md

# 3. Create Backport Tasks
./scripts/cr.sh create "Backport timezone test patterns" "Apply improved patterns..." "refactor"

# 4. Track Progress
./scripts/cr.sh update <backport-cr> "in-progress" "Updating Contact BO tests"
```
