# Working Notes - Contact Management System

## Current Focus: Contact API Implementation
Last Updated: [Current Date]

### What We've Done Today
1. **Test Infrastructure Setup** ✅
   - Created basic test structure for API endpoints
   - Set up test fixtures in conftest.py
   - Configured SQLite in-memory database for testing
   - Implemented session management with transaction isolation
   - Set up test client with proper database context

2. **Contact Model Implementation** ✅
   - Implemented base model with UUID primary key
   - Defined required fields:
     - `name` (required, string, 1-100 chars)
   - Defined optional fields:
     - `first_name` (optional, string)
     - `contact_briefing_text` (optional, string)
     - `last_contact` (optional, datetime with UTC)
     - `sub_information` (optional, JSON dict)
     - `hashtags` (optional, list of strings starting with '#')
   - Removed unnecessary fields:
     - Removed `email` field as it wasn't in requirements
     - Removed `phone` field as it wasn't in requirements
     - Removed `birthday` field as it wasn't in requirements

3. **API Endpoint Implementation** ✅
   - POST /api/contacts (Create)
     - Accepts required name field
     - Accepts all optional fields
     - Returns 201 on success with created contact
     - Returns 400 for validation errors
   - GET /api/contacts/{id} (Read)
     - Returns contact by UUID
     - Returns 404 if not found

4. **Error Handling** ✅
   - Standardized error response format using {"error": "message"}
   - Implemented validation error handling
   - Added malformed JSON handling
   - Added not found handling
   - Removed unnecessary error cases (e.g., duplicate email)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Database Design**
   - Using SQLite for testing (in-memory)
   - UUID for primary keys
   - JSON fields for flexible data (sub_information, hashtags)
   - All fields except name are nullable

2. **Validation Rules**
   - Only validate what's required:
     - Name presence and length (1-100 chars)
     - Basic type validation (dict for sub_info, list for hashtags)
   - No additional validation for optional fields
   - No unique constraints

3. **API Design**
   - Clean separation between database models and API schemas
   - Consistent error response format
   - Proper HTTP status codes (201, 400, 404)
   - Proper type conversion between SQLAlchemy and Pydantic

### Current Test Coverage
- **Basic CRUD**
  - ✅ Create with minimal data (just name)
  - ✅ Create with all fields
  - ✅ Get existing contact
  - ✅ Get non-existent contact

- **Validation**
  - ✅ Missing required fields
  - ✅ Invalid name length
  - ✅ Invalid field types (hashtags, sub_information)
  - ✅ Malformed JSON

### Next Steps
1. **Implement Remaining Endpoints**
   - PUT /api/contacts/{id} (Update)
   - DELETE /api/contacts/{id} (Delete)
   - GET /api/contacts (List)

2. **Add Search Functionality**
   - Search by name
   - Filter by hashtags
   - Sort by last_contact

3. **Documentation**
   - OpenAPI documentation
   - API usage examples
   - Error response examples

### Notes on Implementation
- Following strict TDD approach
- Keeping code simple and focused
- Only implementing what's in requirements
- Maintaining clean separation of concerns
- Using type hints consistently
- Following PEP 8 style guide

### Current Understanding
- Test infrastructure is complete and working
- Basic CRUD operations are partially implemented
- Error handling is standardized
- Model validation is appropriately strict
- No unnecessary complexity added

### Blockers/Dependencies
None currently. Basic infrastructure is working and tests are passing.

## Next Update Expected
After implementing the remaining CRUD endpoints (PUT, DELETE, GET list).
