# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD)  
**Project Name:** Contact Management & Note-Taking Solution  

---

## **1. Executive Summary**  
The solution is a responsive React-based application designed to help users manage contacts, take notes, create reminders, and organize information using hashtags. The app integrates AI capabilities (OpenAI Whisper) for voice-to-text note-taking and AI-powered prompts for note summarization, contact briefing, and note reprocessing. The app is designed to be responsive across iPhone, iPad, and desktop devices. It will initially be a locally stored Progressive Web App (PWA) with a Python-based backend, with the potential for cloud storage in the future.

---

## **2. Objectives**  
- Provide users with a centralized platform to manage contacts, notes, statements, and reminders.  
- Enable efficient organization of information using hashtags and categories.  
- Leverage AI to enhance note-taking, summarization, and contact briefing.  
- Ensure a seamless user experience across multiple devices.  

---

## **3. Scope**  
The solution will include the following features:  
1. **Contact Management:** Users can create and manage contacts with detailed information.  
2. **Note-Taking:** Users can create notes manually or via voice-to-text (OpenAI Whisper).  
3. **Statements:** Notes can contain statements with actionable options.  
4. **Reminders:** Users can create reminders with categories.  
5. **Hashtag-Tags:** All information can be tagged, and hashtags can be managed.  
6. **Search Functionality:** Users can search for contacts and notes.  
7. **AI-Prompt Configuration:** AI-powered features for note-taking, contact briefing, and note reprocessing.  
8. **Responsive Design:** The app will be optimized for iPhone, iPad, and desktop.

## **4. User Stories**  

### **4.1 Contact Management**  
- **As a user**, I want to create a contact with fields like Name (required) and optional fields (First Name, Contact-Briefing-Text, etc.) so that I can store and manage contact information.  
- **As a user**, I want to add sub-information to contacts (e.g., family status, professional situation) so that I can store additional details about the contact.  
- **As a user**, I want to search for contacts by name or other fields so that I can quickly find the contact I need.  
- **As a user**, I want to group contacts using hashtags so that I can organize them effectively.  

### **4.2 Note-Taking**  
- **As a user**, I want to create notes manually by typing or via voice-to-text (OpenAI Whisper) so that I can capture information efficiently.  
- **As a user**, I want each note to have a short summary (6-8 words) generated by AI so that I can quickly understand the note's content.  
- **As a user**, I want to edit AI-generated summaries so that I can correct or refine them.  
- **As a user**, I want to add statements to notes with actions like "create reminder" or "mark as important" so that I can take actionable steps based on the note.  
- **As a user**, I want to delete or reprocess notes so that I can manage my notes effectively.  
- **As a user**, I want to search for notes by text or summary so that I can find relevant notes quickly.  

### **4.3 Statements**  
- **As a user**, I want to add statements to notes with fields like Statement Text so that I can break down notes into smaller, actionable items.  
- **As a user**, I want to delete statements or create reminders from statements so that I can manage tasks effectively.  
- **As a user**, I want to mark statements as important so that I can prioritize them.  

### **4.4 Reminders**  
- **As a user**, I want to create reminders with fields like reminder text and category so that I can set tasks or follow-ups.  
- **As a user**, I want to create, edit, and delete reminder categories so that I can organize reminders effectively.  
- **As a user**, I want reminders to appear in an in-app dashboard with options to dismiss, repeat, or flag them.  
- **As a user**, I want recurring reminders (e.g., yearly birthday reminders) to be supported.  

### **4.5 Hashtag-Tags**  
- **As a user**, I want to tag contacts, notes, statements, and reminders with hashtags so that I can organize information effectively.  
- **As a user**, I want to create, delete, and rename hashtags so that I can manage my tags.  
- **As a user**, I want the deletion of a hashtag to remove it from associated objects without deleting the objects themselves so that I can maintain data integrity.  
- **As a user**, I want AI to suggest relevant hashtags based on content (e.g., contact name, note text) so that I can tag items more efficiently.  

### **4.6 AI-Prompt Configuration**  
- **As a user**, I want AI to generate a 6-8 word summary of my voice-to-text notes so that I can quickly understand the note's content.  
- **As a user**, I want AI to generate a Contact-Briefing-Text based on all notes associated with a contact so that I can get a quick overview of the contact.  
- **As a user**, I want AI to reprocess notes to improve their content or summary so that I can enhance the quality of my notes.  
- **As a user**, I want to see an error message if the AI service is unavailable so that I am aware of the issue.  

### **4.7 Responsive Design**  
- **As a user**, I want the app to be responsive and optimized for iPhone, iPad, and desktop so that I can use it seamlessly across devices.
